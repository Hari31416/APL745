# Assignment 8

## Problem 1

![./plots/0101.png](./plots/0101.png)
This is a plot of the first 10 functions in the training set.

---

![./plots/0102.png](./plots/0102.png)
This is an image plot showing all the functions given in the training set. 

- There are 150 functions.
- 100 points are in each function.

This graph shows the training loss with number of epochs. We can see that the loss decreases very sharply.

Next, we will try to evaluate our anti-derviative operator on brand new functions. The first function used is $e^{-x}$. The function, its analytical integration and the integration learned by DeepONet is plotted on a single plot.

![./plots/0105.png](./plots/0105.png)
This is for the function $\cos(5x)$.

---

![./plots/0106.png](./plots/0106.png)
And finally, this is for the function $\cos(x)\sin(x)$.
