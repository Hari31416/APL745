# Assignment 6

## Problem 1

![./plots/0101.png](./plots/0101.png)
This is the displacement with x plot. The analytic solution and the solution learned by the model are plotted on top of each other.

This is the total loss plot. The loss is decreasing and becomes almost zero after 10 epochs.

## Problem 2

![./plots/0201.png](./plots/0201.png)
This is the $EA$ with x plot. Same as before, the analytic solution and the solution learned by the model are plotted on top of each other.

![./plots/0202.png](./plots/0202.png)
This is the total loss plot. The loss is decreasing and becomes almost zero after 10 epochs.
