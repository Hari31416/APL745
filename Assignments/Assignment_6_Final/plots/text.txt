### This is the displacement with x plot. The analytic solution and the solution learned by the model are plotted on top of each other.
### This is the total loss plot. The loss is decreasing and becomes almost zero after 10 epochs.

### This is the $EA$ with x plot. Same as before, the analytic solution and the solution learned by the model are plotted on top of each other.
